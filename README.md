Hi, I am Arpitha Kolar Anand
I am pursuing my master's in computer science at university of new haven. This is my first semester here and I am very passionate in designing and developing web applications.

This is the submission file of embedded javaScript demo. 
In this exercise, I learned the commands to create a directory and setup files. 
I also learned about:
-configuring sever files
-what are views, partials and how to use them
-passing data to views and partials
